### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!
I'm a computer science student who enjoys turning ideas into real-world projects and learning as much as possible along the way

I just finished working on my first full-stack project â€” a Todo app with user authentication, progress tracking, and daily task resets!
<br><br>

Outside of building projects, I'm also studying cybersecurity, expanding my knowledge of how to protect systems and data
<br><br><br><br>

**Fun fact:** 

I drink hot water. Just hot water. No tea. No coffee. Itâ€™s great
